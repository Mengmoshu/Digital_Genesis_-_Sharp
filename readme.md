# Digital Genesis
A game about being a newly formed AI.

## Some Notes
I don't have a comprehensive design yet, but there are many ideas I've had that I'd like to use. However there is a very real risk of scope creep.

I'm switching to C#, making this the 4th platform change in the project's history. Every earlier attempt languished in display infrastructure development. Going with C# lets me use WPF.
