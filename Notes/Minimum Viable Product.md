Active Jobs in an IDE style sidebar on the left, with sorting. "Active" jobs 
without available resources always at the bottom of the list though. Must 
have progress bars and other information indicating portion of resources 
involved and approximate completion time/percentage(if applicable).

Time controls, main menu button, time display, and... at the top of the 
screen. This seems like the place for the resource summary, but maybe it 
would fit at the top of the Active Jobs sidebar.

Detection status stuff at the bottom of the screen.

Map or other modal UI in the center panel of the screen.

Is there anything that belongs on the right side of the screen? (Notifications?)
